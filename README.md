important function:
----------------------------

if i have a list of words, for example:
best of vienna austria
best vienna guide book
best vienna hotels
best vienna travel guide
booking com vienna
booking vienna

and i use the "Add / Remove" button and type on the right input box "guide", then press "GO", here is what the list will show:
best vienna guide book
best vienna travel guide

let's say i select those 2 lines now and delete them, i then go back into the "Add / Remove" input box and remove the word "guide", then press "GO", here is what the list will show:
best of vienna austria
best vienna hotels
booking com vienna
booking vienna

the export function should work at any time whenever the currently selected or filtered list shows, if i use Add/Remove "guide" and it only shows all keywords with the word "guide", i then press "EXPORT/SHARE", it will only export the 2 lines, even though in the background the full list of keywords is still present

---------------------------

- thats it, the mockup i made is attached :) including the logo
(the "undo" icon should undo the last step always)
